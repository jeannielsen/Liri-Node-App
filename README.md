# Liri-Node-App
Description:

In this assignment, I attempted to make LIRI. LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


Languages Used:
Node, JSON

Feedback:
I was able to access Spotify and search for songs and return the parameters requested for the song.  
I was also able to access OMBD and search for movies, but was not able to return all of the requested parameters.  I ended up commenting out the lines of console log that I attempted to use to log the parameters requested.  
I was able to access Bands in Town, but have not had time to reformat the data response into a useable format.
